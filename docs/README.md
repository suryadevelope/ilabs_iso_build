## Add New Category For Posts

1. Add a new page file for the category at `pages/posts/<category_name>.html`
   with the following contents. Replace `<category_name>` with the actual name
   for the category in the file name and [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter).
   The `category_name` variable is used by [`category.html`](_includes/category.html)
   to load posts for the category. Check [`general.html`](pages/posts/general.html)
   for the `general` category as a sample.

   ```
   ---
   layout: default
   title: <category_name> Posts
   permalink: /posts/<category_name>
   category_name: <category_name>
   ---

   {% include category.html %}
   ```

2. Add `[<category_name>](/posts/<category_name>)` link to category in
   [`posts.md`](pages/posts.md) like [General](/posts/general). The link url
   must match the `permalink` defined in category page above.

## Add New Post In Category

Check [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts) and [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#adding-a-new-post-to-your-site)
for details.

1. Add the file for the post under the directory for the category at
   `_posts/<category_name>/YYYY-MM-DD-POST_TITLE.md`. For example, by
   creating the file `_posts/general/1970-01-01-post-title.md`, jekyll
   will automatically create a route for the post at `general/1970/01/01/post-title.html`.
   Also make sure to set the `category` in the front matter and also
   ensure its the same as category directory name under the `_path`
   directory, otherwise jekyll will not add the category to
   `site.categories` used by [`category.html`](_includes/category.html)
   and the posts won't show for the category.

   ```
   ---
   layout: post
   title:  "Post Title"
   category: <category_name>
   ---

   Post Content
   ```

2. Add any asset files used by the post under the
   `assets/posts/<category_name>/YYYY-MM-DD-POST_TITLE` directory, like
   `assets/general/1970-01-01-post-title` and link to them with
   `[Text Asset](/assets/general/1970-01-01-post-title/asset.txt)` or
   `![Image Asset](/assets/general/1970-01-01-post-title/asset.png)`.
   Check [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#including-images-and-resources)
   for more.

3. Ensure that the first paragraph of the post is a just a short description
   of the post since that text will show in the posts list for the category.
   This is done by setting `show_excerpts` to `true` in [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
   and used by [`category.html`](_includes/category.html). Check
   [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts) for more info.
