[1;36mTerminal gestures:[0m

 [0;36m- Pinch-zooming: resize console text.[0m
 [0;36m- Short tap: left mouse button click in compatible programs.[0m
 [0;36m- Long tap: open context menu.[0m

[1;36mWhy console text can get messed up[0;36m: due to serial console
nature, text resize actually does not change size of terminal
and interface could get messed up. Use command [0;32mresize [0;36mafter
changing text size.[0m

[1;36mPreventing host sleep mode[0;36m: if you need to run the virtual
machine while device screen is off, a wake lock should be
enabled. You can toggle it through the notification. Disabled
wake lock can lead to system clock appearing to be out-of-sync
or pausing of the whole VM.[0m

[1;36mKey shortcuts[0;36m: application supports combinations of keys from
touch keyboard and Volume-Up/Volume-Down buttons. Volume-Down
emulates the Ctrl key and Volume-Up can be used to produce
special input:[0m

[1;36mPort forwarding[0;36m: VM is configured to forward ports of SSH (22)
and Web (80) services. Both ports are exposed as random ones
on the host and are world-accessible within your local network.
You can view the host ports through the context menu. They are
shown on related tabs "Open SSH" and "Open Web" which used to
launch clients for respective services.[0m

[1;36mShared storage volume[0;36m:

  [0;32mmount -t 9p host_storage /mnt[0m

[0;36mThe shared storage volume is a directory shared between host
OS and VM. Use it to transfer files between vmConsole and
other applications.[0m

[0;36mYou can access this directory by using any file manager that
supports Storage Access Framework. You can open a standard
file manager by pressing "Open File Manager" button in the
context menu of vmConsole. In this case the shared volume
should be shown as a tab named "vmConsole" in the drawer.[0m

[1;96m= INSTALLING SYSTEM ON DISK =[0m

[0;36mDefault installation is diskless and files are stored on tmpfs.
All changes like configuration or your files are discarded once
the virtual machine was rebooted or shut down. There is a limit
on size of temporary file system, which significantly limits
the packages you can install.[0m

[0;36mAlpine Linux can be installed on persistent disk using the
utility [0;32msetup-disk[0;36m. An example command is shown below.[0m

  [0;32mexport ROOT_SIZE=4096[0m
  [0;32msetup-disk -m sys -s 0 /dev/sda[0m

[0;36mThis command installs the system on 4 GiB root parition and
disables swap. The variable ROOT_SIZE specified root partition
size in MiB. Note that size of persistent disk is 32 GiB, but
actual used size must be below available free space on host.[0m

[0;36mIt is recommended that after installation you will edit the
bootloader configuration file (extlinux.conf) and add these
parameters to kernel command line:[0m

  [0;32mconsole=ttyS0,115200 tsc=unstable nowatchdog[0m

[0;36mAdditionally you may want to remove option "quiet" to have the
boot logs shown on console.[0m

[1;31mWARNING: vmConsole application requires proper skills of Linux
administration in order to be useful. And considering that
interface is only text-based terminal, you also need to read
the printed text carefully in order to not miss important
notice. This message is not exception. Good luck :)[0m
